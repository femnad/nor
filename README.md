A tiny wrapper around [wpctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WirePlumber).

## Why?

* Use as volume setting commands for WMs without native volume modifier functionality
* Can double as sink picker (via [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) or [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim)) as [pavucontrol](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) conflicts with Pipewire packages now (at least for Ubuntu 23.10)
